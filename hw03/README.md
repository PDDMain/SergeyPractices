# HW Tasks

## Task 1: Merge Two Sorted Lists

**Problem:**  
You are given two sorted lists of integers, A and B. Your task is to merge them into a single sorted list without duplicates.

**Input:**  
The first line contains the integers in list A (space-separated).  
The second line contains the integers in list B (space-separated).

**Output:**  
A single line containing the merged sorted list without duplicates, space-separated.

**Example Input:**  
```
1 3 5 7

## Task 2: Frequency of Elements

**Problem:**  
Given a list of integers, determine the frequency of each unique element and display them in ascending order of the elements.

**Input:**  
A single line containing the integers in the list (space-separated).

**Output:**  
Each line should contain an element and its frequency, separated by a space, sorted by the elements in ascending order.

**Example Input:**  
```
4 5 6 5 4 3 2 4 5
```

**Example Output:**  
```
2 1

## Task 3: Anagram Groups

**Problem:**  
You are given a list of words. Group the words that are anagrams of each other.

**Input:**  
The first line contains an integer n, the number of words.  
The next n lines each contain a single word.

**Output:**  
Each group of anagrams should be printed on a separate line, with words separated by spaces. The groups should be ordered by the first occurrence of any word in the group.

**Example Input:**  
```
6
