# Easy Dynamic Programming Tasks

## Task 5: Fibonacci Sequence

**Problem:**  
Write a program to compute the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

```
Fib(0) = 0  
Fib(1) = 1  
Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2) for n > 1  
```

**Input:**  
A single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 30).

**Output:**  
A single integer representing the nth Fibonacci number.

**Example Input:**  
```
7  
```

**Example Output:**  
```
13  
```

## Task 6: Climbing Stairs

**Problem:**  
You are climbing a staircase that has n steps. You can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Write a program to determine how many distinct ways you can climb to the top.

**Input:**  
A single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30).

**Output:**  
A single integer representing the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

**Example Input:**  
```
4  
```

**Example Output:**  
```
5  
```

**Explanation:** The five ways to climb to the top are:
- 1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step  
- 1 step + 1 step + 2 steps  
- 1 step + 2 steps + 1 step  
- 2 steps + 1 step + 1 step  
- 2 steps + 2 steps
